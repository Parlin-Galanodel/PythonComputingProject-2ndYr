After doing this project, I have learnt some concept in OOP and felt it by writing
some code in this style.

As said in tutorial, OOP contains three main part: 
	1. encapsulation, 
	2. inheritance,
	3. polymorphism.
	
Encapsulation is the basic idea to build a class since it is the way we deal with
the informations related. We could put all the attributes and functions into a single
piece of code by construct an abstract concept, object. This makes data related to
each other been organized and more manageable.

Inheritance expand the level of object. With the help of inheritance, a multi-level
or hierarchy of concept separated in different levels while still related to its
own super classes and subclasses. Moreover, if the code(attribute and methods) in 
super class is the same in its derived class, they would be reusable and same methods
would not be implemented twice.

Polymorphism is used to manage the hierarchy structure generated better. The methods
with same name in different levels could hold different meanings or different purpose.

Information hiding & Interface:

The other two concept in OOP are information hiding and interface.

Information hiding could be used to hide some attributes and methods not intended
to be used by a user from been seen or changed from outside. Also, it means hide
the information details as in other languages.

Interface is real fascinating design as it provide convenient way to reuse code
and manage different object with similar function. This is more useful in python
as it is a duck typed language as the different object with same interface could 
be used as same thing in functions outside.
